# jutsu-doc2vec-example

Clojure project meant to show an example of using jutsu for nlp tasks such as doc2vec.

# Tutorial

If you want to follow along with me after downloading the code here are the steps

I use an ubuntu server started up on digital ocean to get a fresh vm.

Download the news articles zip with:

`wget http://mlg.ucd.ie/files/datasets/bbc-fulltext.zip`

Then install unzip tool:
`sudo apt-get unzip`

```
mkdir articles
unzip bbc-fulltext.zip -d articles
```

Its important that you place all of the articles in the articles directory,
because later we will be able to point our word2vec model to that directory and it will load in all of the files.

Install git:
`sudo apt-get install git`

Download project:
`git clone https://github.com/hswick/jutsu-doc2vec-example.git`

Install java:

`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`

Install boot with this one liner bash command documented on the boot README

sudo bash -c "cd /usr/local/bin && curl -fsSLo boot https://github.com/boot-clj/boot-bin/releases/download/latest/boot.sh && chmod 755 boot"

You will need to create a boot.properties and set boot as root
`echo "BOOT_AS_ROOT=yes" > boot.properties`

Then you can verify boot is working by running `boot repl`

Exit out of the repl so we can start to setup our clojure project.

We can kickstart this process with one of my templates

`boot -d boot/new new -t boot-nightlight-template -n news-articles`

news-articles is the project name.

Run `echo "BOOT_AS_ROOT=yes" > boot.properties` in your project directory

Start up nightlight:

`boot night`

ssh -L 9000:localhost:4000 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS

This will start nightlight on port 4000 and expose it on port 9000.

Then connect to it via ssh tunneling

ssh -L 9000:localhost:4000 :: -L 9001:localhost:4001 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS

Exposes multiple ssh tunnels to access nightlight and jutsu

And access nightlight by typing localhost:9000 in your browser (this may take a couple seconds to load).

This will allow you to run your code

# Usage

Run `boot night` to startup nightlight and begin editing your project in a browser.

Execute the code to write the output data with `boot run`.

To plot, run `boot repl` and execute this code in the repl like this:

```clojure
boot.user=> (require '[cheshire.core :as kitty])
nil
boot.user=> (def graph-data (kitty/parse-string (slurp "news-articles-graph-data.json")))
#'boot.user/graph-data
boot.user=> (require '[jutsu.core :as j])
nil
boot.user=> (j/start-jutsu! 4002 false)
Starting http-kit...
"http://localhost:4002/"
boot.user=> (j/graph! "News Articles" graph-data)
1
```
